			<h1>1). Essay that introduces my portfolio and argues my standing in this class</h1>
			<p>Developing a good thesis statement using secondary sources and primary sources that are analyzed to form an argument improves confidence of a writer. Confident writing starts with breaking down the essay into small parts before writing the main essay. Finding the right secondary sources poses as a challenge. However, searching through e-resources and books for peer-reviewed sources improves credibility of secondary sources. An effective rhetoric analysis essay not only identifies and discusses styles but also creates a central argument. As a linguistic study student, writing a thesis driven essay that interests the reader is completely important. Writing a good essay for a linguistic student revolves around finding the right sources and forming a convincing argument</p>
			<p>YTo be a strong rhetor one would require to possess the skill of developing a good thesis statement. A good rhetor is one that can build upon a central idea throughout the essay. A good rhetor’s work can be described as cohesive. Each of the sentences result in the central idea of the essay through supporting it or refuting it. He avoids sentences that are not contributing to the thesis in his essay. Most importantly he keeps his scope narrow from the point he starts to write to the point that he finishes.</p>
			<p>Being a good rhetor comes with overcoming challenges, writing has many challenges. One of the challenges is finding the right secondary sources that contribute to the thesis statement. Most likely searching through e-resources brings many results. What is important is not picking each and every article, but picking credible sources that contribute towards the thesis statement. An essay that fails to incorporate good primary and secondary sources fails to achieve a convincing argument. It is thus the responsibility of a good rhetor to overcome this barrier and find the right sources and build a convincing argument.</p>
			<p>Writing more confidently involves breaking down the essay into small parts first before writing the main essay. A breakdown has topic sentences written in chronologic order of how they are going to appear on the essay. After breaking down the essay into small sentences what remains is to construct a good thesis statement. The thesis statement at this point becomes easy to form since it is all a matter of linking all the sentence topic sentences.</p>
			<p>With a thesis statement, a list of topic sentences then writing across this lines creates a cohesive manuscript. It is absolutely necessary that secondary sources be credible and up to date. Also linking the secondary sources and the primary sources is important part of writing. As a linguistic study rhetoric analysis ought to be linked to a central argument.</p>
			<p>Developing a good statement, using secondary sources, breaking down an essay into small bits before writing, and finding the right secondary sources determine a good rhetor. While writing the RA essay it was easy to identify rhetorical styles but challenging to write on a central argument. Through browsing e-resources and academic journals it becomes easy to find information that build up to the thesis statement. As a linguistic study students Ted Chiang is a master of rhetoric styles and developing an analysis of the rhetoric devices for one of his stories offers many examples to choose from. However to do so secondary and primary sources must be well analyzed and tied together towards contributing to a central thesis statement as we shall see in the manuscript below.</p>
			<h1> 2). RA draft</h1>
			<h1>Rhetorical styles used in story of your life</h1>
			<p>Through first and second person narration, Chiang tells a story about science and linguistics study. He blends adjectives with dictions forming a fantasy world for the reader. Also, he uses symbolism through characters in his narrative. He makes linguistics reign supreme in the ‘battle’ of understanding alien language against science. The author authorizes his ethos to the reader through defying the norm that science is better than languages Author’s endorsement for languages makes him win over the hearts of language scholars but still raise a debate about how language would be better in studying alien language compared to science.</p>
			<p>The science experts do not get a breakthrough translating the language of the aliens to human language but Louise gets a breakthrough by understanding how their language is constructed. At this point in the story, Louise explains to Gary how aliens construct their sentences through writing logograms: “Their script isn’t word divided; a sentence is written by joining the logograms for the constituent words. They join the logograms by rotating and modifying them. Take a look. I showed him how the logograms were rotated” (Chiang 111) Salvatierra (2018) notes that Louise is speaking from a first-person perspective and this allows the audience know exactly what learning Hetapod B is doing to her. Hetapod B is a name given to the alien’s written language. The scientists cannot establish language and that is why they have less success proving their hypothesis in this research. But, Dr. Louise a linguistic, is able to get the feedback that she wants because she has experience with studying new languages.</p>
			<p>The more that the story unfolds the more the theme of science and language unfold as told from the perspective of Louise’s personal life and the aliens. Ted Chiang’s use of Louise’s personal life and the alien’s life in the story allows him to engage his audience in a discussion about the importance of language in translating alien language. For example in page (119) of the novel Chiang indicates that, days were becoming weeks and the physicists were becoming disillusioned by contrast the linguistics were having more success. To support this statement, (Latchman) shows a similar thought when he states that the story is based on Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. The hypothesis states that language is both a way to express thoughts and ideas and indicates how humans perceive the world (Latchman). That is why Ted indicates that science has less success and language has more success because language is what forms perceptions of the world. But he does so by telling the story from the perspective of Louise’s personal life thus making her the main character</p>
			<p>To achieve this Ted uses first person narration where Louise narrates her own story. For example, she narrates the story of how she will have a daughter who will die very young. We can deduce this from when the story starts and Louise fast forwards of how she will tell her of the night that she was conceived. This is a sad part but there will also be happy times such as when she will be telling her stories. One of the stories will be the 1770 story about Captain Cook and his ship Endeavor (Chiang 105). She always tells this story to her introductory course every year and explains it afterwards, because it is a classic antidote. The sessions that she conducted will form a better story to tell her students. She will have to tell of the success story that she and other linguistics had during the alien invasion through video tapes. To emphasize in this point, even the other characters in the story are shaped by what Louise reacts and responds to what they say or do (Salvatiera). This style makes the story unique, if it was told using a third or second-person perspective the reader would not get some details about the life of Dr. Louise.</p>
			<p>Ted Chiang always indicates Louise to be the one taking the lead in all the aspects of the story. For example, when Louise and Gary are together in the looking glass Louise is the one conducting experiments on the hetapods and Gary is watching. When Louise walks into the looking glass the hetapod on the other side does the same. The image was so real that her skin crawled. She could see the texture of its gray skin, she pointed at herself and said slowly, “human” and then she pointed at Gary. “Human” she then points at the alien and asks what are you? For the first time she does not get a reaction, so she tries again and then again. One of the hetapods pointed to itself with one limb, Louise exclaims, that is lucky (Chiang 103). From another scholar’s perspective, Chang’s story is representing philosophical and scientific interpretations on timeless topics (Glazier and Beck). (Burke) points that scientific studies have the effect of being bilingual and multilingual whereas language has an effect on the speaker. These two theories add to the argument that language and science are offering two separate perspectives. Chang has more interest in getting his reader to appreciate the role of language as compared to that of science. That is why Chang is indicating Louise to be the one taking the lead in the ongoing alien encounter.</p>
			<p>Gary, Dr. Louise’s husband only gets a single breakthrough in gaining a response from the hetapods. The Physics discussions were going poorly but the linguistics were having more success (Chiang 119). The only success that the Physics people had was in Illinois with the Fermat’s principle of least time. Apart from this success, in most of the other experiments the hetapods responded with requesting better clarification. Scientists also had success, but only in the most concrete terms (Chiang 119). For example when the hetapods were presented with the periodic table after a couple of times they finally started getting the idea. For anything else that was less abstratct the scientific researchers have been gibbering. Gary reported how they had tried to ask the aliens the terms that they used for acceleration and mass but had been given a response to be clearer. (Burke) claims that since ancient times language has been used as a tool to understand the physical world. This statement is true because language is also efficient because the aliens also have a language of their own. With the aliens having a language of their own, then it would be easy for the linguistic professor to study it. By understanding their language she would thus obtain the intentions of the aliens and why they had invaded the planet.</p>
			<p>Ted intertwines language and linguistic in a clever way just as he interconnects the analogy of her daughter’s life with her experience in the military camp. The story cleverly switches from the dimension of her experience with the aliens with another allusion of her daughter’s life. (Glazier and Beck) also note that just as the starting double entendre comprises, in itself, an insinuation to the story’s finish, there exists a notable structural repetition in Chiang’s narrative that intertwines concepts of Armageddon, language, and temporality in significantly creative methods. The same concept applies to the argument that linguistics achieve better results in the study of alien language compared to science. Thus Ted achieves in showing how language is as equally an important part of life thus establishing his ethos.</p>
			<p>Chiang also uses symbolism to show how language is better by using alien symbols and language in his story. He gives the aliens characteristics of human beings such as the ability to have a language of their own. Dr. Banks studies the language of the aliens and concludes that their language can be described as Semagram (Chiang 117). According to (Burke) humans think of events as cause and effect and arrange events in chronological order. He goes ahead to state that aliens think of things according to what happens in the future. Louise study of the aliens makes her only to think like them and changes the way that she remembers (Burke). That is why the story begins with an ending which is a great use of symbolism. Also anecdotes of what will happen to her daughter’s life in future make the story even more interesting to read through. This examples are just to mention a few of instances that Ted applies symbolism in the novel.</p>
			<p>In this essay we have taken a journey through Ted Chiang’s “story of your life” and how the author applies great literary devices. The essay began with how science experts did not get a breakthrough during the apocalyptic alien invasion. The essay transitioned to how Ted used Louise’s personal life to bring a hope to the apocalypse. The essay went ahead to claim that, first-person narration dominates in the story from the main characters point of view. The essay then went ahead to show how Louis the main character saved the scenario that had caused a lot of agony. The essay also showed how the antagonist Gray was involved in the whole scenario through offering help to the main character. The essay also showed that Ted uses a double entendre approach in telling this great story. Finally, the essay showed some of the great examples of symbolism that the author uses in the story.</p>
			<p>In conclusion, through first and second person narration, Chiang tells a story about science and linguistics study. He blends adjectives with dictions forming a fantasy world for the reader. Also, he uses symbolism through characters in his narrative. He makes linguistics reign supreme in the ‘battle’ of understanding alien language against science. The author authorizes his ethos to the reader through defying the norm that science is better than languages. Author’s endorsement for languages makes him win over the hearts of language scholars but still raise a debate about how language would be better in studying alien language compared to science</p>

			<h1>4). Artifacts </h1>
			<p>RA (exploratory draft).</p>
			<p>Communicating is an important part of any book or article because the message is what connects the reader with the writer. Some of the writing styles that were discussed during this research formed an important part of the RA because they were analyzed in detail. Also important aspects of writing including use of diction and novums were established in the story.</p>
			<p>CR-1: Movie v. Story</p>
			<p>Adapting a book story to a movie raises differences and similarities that make each medium unique. For example in the movie Arrival Louise achieves emotional connection with the audience by dramatizing and in the book by being the main character. This differences make the adaptation point out some aspects of the story that we cannot easily tell through reading.</p>
			<p>Critical Reading #2 (superheros).</p>
			<p>Ted Chiang uses a rhetoric technique that forces the attention of his audience to a certain audience by going against the expectations of what should happen in the story. As a linguistic study student it is not the ordinary for the main character to be a linguistic professor. Ted however defies this norm and places Louis as the main character.</p>
